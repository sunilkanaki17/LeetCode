// Your laptop keyboard is faulty, and whenever you type a character 'i' on it, it reverses the string that you have written. Typing other characters works as expected.
// You are given a 0-indexed string s, and you type each character of s using your faulty keyboard.
// Return the final string that will be present on your laptop screen.

// Example 1:

// Input: s = "string"
// Output: "rtsng"
  
// Explanation: 
// After typing first character, the text on the screen is "s".
// After the second character, the text is "st". 
// After the third character, the text is "str".
// Since the fourth character is an 'i', the text gets reversed and becomes "rts".
// After the fifth character, the text is "rtsn". 
// After the sixth character, the text is "rtsng". 
// Therefore, we return "rtsng".

class Solution {
public:
    string finalString(string s) {
        string x="";
        for(int i=0;i<s.size();i++)
        {
            if(s[i]=='i')
            {
               reverse(x.begin(),x.end());
            }
            else
            {
                x+=s[i];
            }
        }
        return x;
    }
};
